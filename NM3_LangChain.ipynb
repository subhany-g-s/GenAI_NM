The study found that XGBoost achieved the best model accuracy of 97%. The researchers used SHAP analysis to interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of each feature on the model's output. The study aims to aid in the understanding and trustworthiness of the classification results, as breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and manual diagnosis is time-consuming. The study also highlights the importance of machine learning and Explainable AI in cancer classification.\n"

However, the symptoms you've mentioned are common with a variety of illnesses such as the common cold, flu, or even gastrointestinal infections.\n",
            "\n",
            "The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat, usually caused by one of many types of viruses. Symptoms can include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, and mild fever.\n",
            "\n",
            "The flu, or influenza, is also a viral infection that can cause fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle or body aches. It's important to note that the flu can sometimes cause stomach symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but this is more common in children than adults.\n",
            "\n",
            "Gastrointestinal infections, such as food poisoning or stomach flu (gastroenteritis), can cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but may also cause fever and a cough.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given these possibilities, it's recommended to seek medical attention if your symptoms persist, especially if you have a high fever, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, or if you're experiencing dehydration (signs of which can include dry mouth, little or no urination, severe thirst, and dark-colored urine).\n",
            "\n",
            "In the meantime, it's important to rest, stay hydrated, and manage your symptoms with over-the-counter medications as needed. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help with fever, headache, and body aches, while cough suppressants can help with a persistent cough. Drinking plenty of fluids can help with hydration and soothe a sore throat.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's also important to practice good hygiene to prevent the spread of illness, such as washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.\n"
